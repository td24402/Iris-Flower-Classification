# Iris-Flower-Classification

This project performs classification of Iris flower species using a variety of machine learning algorithms. It utilizes the well-known Iris dataset, which contains sepal and petal measurements for three types of iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

# Project Highlights

Data Cleaning

    Removed irrelevant columns (Id)

    Checked for missing/duplicate values (none found)

    Identified outliers using boxplots

Exploratory Data Analysis

    Pairplot colored by species

    3D scatter plot of Petal Length, Petal Width, and Sepal Width

    Correlation heatmap for feature relationships

    Descriptive statistics by species

Modeling

    Algorithms used:

        Decision Tree

        Random Forest

        K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

        Support Vector Machine (SVM)

    Feature scaling applied for SVM only

    Dataset split into 80% training / 20% testing

# Visualization Methods 

Pairplot (colored by species)

3D scatter plot

Correlation heatmap

Boxplots for outlier detection

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how classical machine learning models can effectively classify biological data when features are well-separated and well-understood. The Iris dataset serves as a great introductory example for classification tasks.
